In order to update or upgrade to the latest mediawiki, you'll need to re-pull
and re-push.

    $ cd mediawiki/
    $ git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
2) Push the new changes upstream
    $ git push


Repo layout
===========
php/ - Externally exposed php code goes here
libs/ - Additional libraries
misc/ - For not-externally exposed php code
../data - For persistent data
.openshift/pear.txt - list of pears to install
.openshift/action_hooks/build - Script that gets run every push, just prior to
    starting your app


Notes about layout
==================
Please leave php, libs and data directories but feel free to create additional
directories if needed.

Note: Every time you push, everything in your remote repo dir gets recreated
please store long term items (like an sqlite database) in ../data which will
persist between pushes of your repo.


pear.txt
===========

A list of pears to install, line by line on the server.  This will happen when
the user git pushes.
